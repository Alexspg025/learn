\begin_layout Title
Language Learning Diary - Part Seven
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
March 2022 - present

\begin_layout Abstract
The language-learning effort involves research and software development
 to implement the ideas concerning unsupervised learning of grammar, syntax
 and semantics from corpora.
 This document contains supplementary notes and a loosely-organized semi-chronol
ogical diary of results.
 The notes here might not always makes sense; they are a short-hand for
 my own benefit, rather than aimed at you, dear reader!

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Part Seven of the diary on the language-learning effort opens the door to
 next steps.
 The last round of experiments appear to be successful, and there do not
 seem to be any nagging unresolved issues.
 What comes next?

The Possibilities

\begin_layout Standard
The last round of experiments appear to be successful, and there do not
 seem to be any nagging unresolved issues.
 What comes next? Here's a list of possbilities.

\series bold
Accuracy Evaluation.

\series default
 Compare dictionaries to the hand-crafted LG English dict.
 This is a bit tedious and boring, since it seems unlikely to yeild anything
 interesting.
 It seems inevitable, as its the kind of thing other people want to see.
 The only benefit is that it is a way of perhaps characterizing the the
 effects of different parameter choices.
 In current runs, the

 parameter is the most highly explored: but what setting yeilds the best
 results? Comparing to LG should reveal the answer.

\series bold
Data Cleanup.

\series default
 During pair-counting and/or MPG parsing, there is a bug that repeatedly
 escapes backslashes, leading to a cascade of backslashes in the dataset.
 This is just junk, and should be fixed.
 Fixing it will surely improve quality.
 It's tedious and boring.
 Two ways to fix: (1) start from scratch (2) hunt out multiple backslashes,
 and perform a custom merge, just like a word-class merge, but without forming
 a word-class.
 Option (2) is maybe easier and faster, but requires crafting custom code.
 Option (1) is foundationally better but time consuming.

Improve accuracy (by iteration).

\series default
 Given the initial dictionaries, the corpus can be parsed with the LG parser,
 using those dictionaries.
 By maintaining counts of which disjuncts are actually used during parsing,
 we discover what is actually being used.
 These results can be used to cut down the word-classes, by eliminating
 those Sections that are rarely or never actually used during parsing.
 Such a trim helps reduce the dictionary size.
