\begin_layout Abstract
The OpenCog Learning project explores novel techniques for the induction
 of symbolic structure from environmental sources.
 As a first application of these ideas , the automated learning of the grammatic
al structure of English is explored.The language-learning effort involves
 research and software development to implement the ideas concerning unsupervise
d learning of grammar, syntax and semantics from corpora.
 This document provides a summary of results observed to date.

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the OpenCog Learning project is to induce structure from raw
 observational data.
 In the most naive sense, this would be visual or auditory data.
 In a more sophisticated sense, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

observational data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should be taken to be data that might already have some structure in it,
 as the goal of learning is to do so hierarchically, recursively: to deduce
 structure in structure inside of structure...
 If this can be made to work, then, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

starting in the middle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is not a bad place to start.
 In the present case, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the middle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a corpus of English text, and the goal is to extract grammatical structure.
 The words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

grammatical structure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are meant to encompass morphological structure, syntactic structure, and
 lower reaches of semantic understanding, as far as this can be pushed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general theory of how this is to be done is sketched out in a companian
 article.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Vepstas2022symbolic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 The overall process is as follows: first, one computes the mutual information
 (MI) between word-pairs occurring in the corpus.
 The MI assigns a numerical score to how often a pair of words occur near
 each-other.
 This can be used to generate a maximum spanning tree (MST) parse of the
 text, which appears to capture the syntactic structure of the text reasonably
 well.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yuret1998"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 This parse tree can be disassembled into individual 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

jigsaw puzzle pieces
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which encode the syntactic structure of the parse.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sleator1991,Sleator1993"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 Individual jigsaw pieces encode the local syntactic environment of a given
 word.
 Collections of such jigsaw pieces can be understood to be vectors: each
 word is endowed with a lexis of all of the syntactic contexts in which
 it was observed.
 But this is too fine-grained; one whishes to generalize from the particular
 to the general.
 The vectors can be used both to discover words that have similar syntactic
 contexts (based on the similarity of the local environments) and also to
 factor out different word-senses, since different syntactic contexts associate
 strongly with distinct word-senses.

This text provides reports on the algorithms developed to perform the above,
 and on the statistical properties of the resulting graphical networks.
 This report is a summary, encompassing more than a decade of research and

 Rather than peppering this text with self-citations, footnotes will be
 used to indicate which to examine.

\end_inset

 There are obvious directions in which both the theory and the experiment
 could be taken, but so far haven't been.
 In the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

downwards
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 direction, work on morphology, needed for Indo-European languages, and
 segmentation, needed for Chinese.
 Further down, the implementation of the same ideas to extract phonetic
 structure and perform general audio processing.
 In the upwards direction, one could could search for high-MI pairs across
 sentences, both to resolve references and to detect entities.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

syntatactic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 relationships between entities presumably encodes thier semantic properties.
 Such syntactic relations can also be extracted between different sense
 streams, say, between words and blueprints/diagrams, or words and photographs,
 or even perhaps big-data settings such as computer vulnerability databases,
 or financial news and stock prices.
 The author beleives the basic algorithm is generic, and can be ratcheted
 upwards, to arbitrarily high reaches.
 Whether this proves to be true cannot be known without actual experiments;
 the current limitation to carrying these out is the develpment of a sutiable
 software infrastructure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this paper focuses on the narrow tasks defined above, in
 the same order as given.
 The computation of word-pairs results in a graph, whose vertexes are words,
 and whose edges are word-pairs.
 What are the statistical properties of this graph? MST parsing and the
 creating of jigsaw pieces results in a matrix of word, connector-sequence
 pairs.
 What asre the statistical properties of this matrix? The similarity between
 words can be judged with assorted different measures; how do these behave,
 and how does clustering and word-sense disambiguation proceed, in practice?
\end_layout

Software Infrastructure

The software infrastructure used to perform the above can be found in the

 as a foundational layer.
 The AtomSpace is an in-RAM graph database with powerful graph query capabilitie
s, tuned for performance.
 It has shims that allow data to be stored in conventional disk databases
 and to be distributed across the network.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 it allows arbitary collections of subgraphs to be used as the basis elements
 of a vector space.
 If one has two such vector spaces, then pairs of elements form a matrix
 of rows and columns.
 Given a matrix, it is then straight-forward to compute marginal probabilites,
 conditional probabilities, and other typical statistical quantities.
 This is, of course, quite ordinary: what is new here is that the AtomSpace
 allows extremely sparse matricies to be represented: say, 100K 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 100K entires, of which all but a few million are zero.
 Conventional mathematics and statistics packages do not provide such tools
 for sparse data.
 The other difference between the AtomSpace and conventional statistical
 tools is that the rows and columns are themselves distinct collections
 of subgraphs of some larger graph.
 Given some large graph of data, one can slice-n-dice it in any number of
 ways, and ask how portions of it correlate, by imposing a matrix structure
 on the parts of interest.
 To put those parts under a microscope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the pair-counting stage, the rows and columns of the matrix are words,
 the left and right words, respectively, of an ordered word pair; the matrix
 is approximately square.
 During the word-sense disambiguation and syntactic clustering stage, the
 rows are individal words, and the columns are the connector sequences witnesed
 for those words.
 The conector sequence is thus an example of a non-trivial subgraph.
 The matrix is rectangular; there is typically an order of magnitude more
 connector sequences than there are words: this is simply because each connector
 sequence is a context for a word: it resembles a skip-gram in many ways.

\begin_layout Section*
Pair Counting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obtaining a suitable corpus for exploring the English language is not as
 simple as it seems: it is not enough to train on a dump of Wikipedia articles.
 This is because Wikipedia is descriptive, and has a paucity of verbs, and
 a surfiet of proper nouns and techical terms.
 Verbs such as run, jump, catch: the verbs of everyday outdoor adventure
 are missing.
 This can be remedied by working with a corpus of young adult adventure
 literature.
 Such a corpus is not readily available, but can be pieced together by working
 with Project Gutenberg publications and publicly licensed fan fiction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some minimal amount of cleanup can be useful, but it doesn't seem to be
 critical: if some specialized markup (say, HTML markup) or the occasional
 table, figure caption or index squeezes through, it should not matter much:
 after all these also have structure, and the goal of the project is to
 discern structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The size of the vocabulary increases as the size of the corpus increases.
 This is because of the Zipfian distribution of words: it will always be
 the case that about half of the vocabulary is observed only once: unusual
 given names, obscure geographical place names, foreign language loan words.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Word-pair counting can be done in several different ways: one is to count
 each word-pair occuring within a window of a fixed width, say, of width
 six.
 Another possibility is to count the word-pairs occuring in a completely
 random planar parse of a sentence.
 There does not appear to be much difference between these two syles of
 ounting, although the second style seems more appealing on theoretical
 grounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A good way to characterize the number of observed word-pairs is by means
 of the sparsity: the 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}$
\end_inset

 of the fraction of observed word-pairs vs.
 all possible word-pairs.
 Hewing to an information-theoretic foundation, other characterisitcs include
 the left and right entropies, and the total mutual information.
 This is somewhat more interesting than the more conventional statements
 about the average degree of a vertex in a graph, or the average 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hubbiness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (root-mean-square of the degree).
 This is because of the Zipfian distribution of words: given this, most
 of the graph statistics follow.
 The mutual information is more interesting, as it is a key ingredient to
 an information-theoretic foundation.
 A summary and some graphs follow.

\begin_layout Standard
In the table above, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{R}$
\end_inset

 are the height and width of the matrix (the number of unique words occuring
 on the left and right of observed word-pairs).
 They are almost the same, but not quite: for example, the period never
 occurs at the start of a sentence; capitalized words rarely appear ath
 the end.
 The sizes are given as logarithms, as this makes comparison to entropies
 more immediate.
 The total number of unique pairs is 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\mbox{Tot}}$
\end_inset

 while the total number of observations of these pairs is 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\mbox{Tot}}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sparsity is 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}D_{\mbox{Tot}}/N_{L}\times N_{R}$
\end_inset

, and so is expressed in bits.
 It indicates what fraction of all possible word-pairs are actually observed.
 Note that the sparsity increased by two bits, as the dimensions of the
 matrix increased by two bits (a factor of four; non-trivial in terms of
 compute-time, corpus size and RAM usage.) Thus, rarity is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}D_{\mbox{Tot}}/\sqrt{N_{L}\times N_{R}}$
\end_inset

, and is seen to be approximately constant, independent of dataset size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total entropy is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{\mbox{Tot}}=\sum_{w,v}p\left(w,v\right)\log_{2}p\left(w,v\right)
\]

\end_inset

with the sum ranging over all word-pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w,v\right)$
\end_inset

 and the frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,v\right)=N\left(w,v\right)/N\left(*,*\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(w,v\right)$
\end_inset

 is the oservation count of a pair, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(*,*\right)$
\end_inset

 is the total count over all word-pairs.
 The left entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{\mbox{Left}}=\sum_{w}p\left(w,*\right)\log_{2}p\left(w,*\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(w,*\right)=\sum_{v}p\left(w,v\right)$
\end_inset

 is the left-marginal sum; likewise for the right entropy.
 The mutual information is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI=H_{\mbox{Tot}}-H_{\mbox{Left}}-H_{\mbox{Right}}=\sum_{w,v}p\left(w,v\right)\log_{2}\frac{p\left(w,v\right)}{p\left(w,*\right)p\left(*,v\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notable trends are that the number of distinct pairs increases as the square-roo
t of the possible number of pairs.
 The total number of observations per pair is very nearly constant, increasing
 only slowly with the size of the dataset.
 Notable is that the MI really does appear to be constant, independent of
 the size of the dataset! The low value of the MI, one and a half bits,
 indicates the paucity of word-pairs.
 They convey some information, but not very much.
 On the other hand, the sparsity is quite high: of all possible word pairs
 that could have been observed, only miniscule fractions of a percent are
 actually observed.
 Language is very highly structured.
 The goal of the learning project is to amplify the information content;
 to extract information, to data-mine it.

Remarkably, the overall numbers appear to be language-independent; almost
 identical values are seen for Mandarin Chinese text.

 To perform this counting, each hanzi is taken to be a

.
 This is not technically correct, as Chinese words may consist of one, two,
 three or more hanzi.
 However, segmentation is a challenge, and so at this level, for pair-counting,
 issues of segmentation are ignored.
 Presumably, the discovery of Chinese words as set-phrases will occur later
 in the learning pipeline.

Sample-size Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distribution of word-pairs is conventionally Zipfian, with an exponent
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\approx1.0$
\end_inset

, and is not shown.
 The focus here is on sample-size effects.
 The graph below shows the observation count for vertex degrees, for dataset
 3 above.
 Consider each word to be a vertex, and each observed word-pair an edge.
 This forms a graph.
 The degree of a vertex is the number of edges attached to it.
 What is the distribution of degrees in the graph?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, the distribution is Zipfian, with exponent 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma\approx1.6$
\end_inset

.
 There are two notable sample-size effects.
 At the left-hand side of this graph are words that participate in only
 a handful of word-pairs.
 This dataset has 142K words in it; the graph shows that more than 100K
 of them participate in ten or fewer word-pairs.
 The flattening on the left hand side indicates that these are wildly under-samp
led.
 What are these words? Sample inspection shows that many of these are junk:
 bad punctuation, badly-escaped quotes, typos, stray markup mixed in together
 with foreign-language words, obscure place-names and other rarities.
 It is reasonable, before proceeding to later stages of grammatical induction,
 to label these words as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

junk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and trim them away.
 The result is a dramatically smaller dataset.
 This is a good thing: it occupies less RAM and storage; later algorithmic
 processing runs faster.
 But does trimming damage information? Appearently not; trimming to remove
 more than half the words changes the sparsity not at all, lowers the entropy
 by five percent, and lowers the MI by about a percent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the right-hand side of the graph, a risk to histogramming is exposed.
 These are words that appear in thousands of distinct pairs.
 Yet, for any given,degree-w-fine-raw.eps fixed degree, there are only a
 small handful of words having exactly that degree, and sometimes even zero
 words.
 The higher the degree, the more likely that there are zero words having
 that degree.
 This also is a kind-of undersampling: when generating histograms of distributio
ns, the lack of data in this range will also affect slopes and with it the
 conclusions about the nature of the dataset.
 Words with the very highest degree are punctuation: the period, comma and
 dash, and the determiner 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the

: these appear in pairs with more than 2/3rds of the other words in the
 dataset.

MI Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distribution of word-pair MI is shown below.
 As before, this is for dataset 3, which contains 28 million pairs.
 The MI is sorted into 500 histogram bins.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distribution is clearly not symmetric.
 The two sides appear to be bounded by straight lines.
 The author is unaware of any theoretical explanation for this shape.
 However, the following guess is offered.
 If word-pairs are chosen completely at random, and the number of sampled
 pairs is much smaller than the total possible pairs, then one obtains a
 Gaussian distribution.
 Such a distribution is centered on a small but positive MI, due to sample-size
 effects.
 For larger samples, the mean tends to zero.
 Thus, perhaps the left-hand-side of this figure is just a Gaussian.
 An eyeballed, imprecise fit is shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking this to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

common-mode noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and subtracting it leaves an excess of word pairs with positive MI, having
 a peak near 
\begin_inset Formula $MI\sim4$
\end_inset

.
 The straight-line slope on the right suggests that the excess can be described
 by a log-normal distribution.
 Again, an eye-balled, imprecise fit is shown.
 These two, summed together, model the observed distribution almost perfectly.
 Perhaps a formal expression for the common-mode noise is easily derived,
 given a fixed vocabular size and number of samples.
 Theories of why the remainder would be a log-normal distribution are unknown
 to the author.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pairs with the highest MI are observed very infrequently.
 The highest observable MI value is directly related to the sample size:
 it is a bit below the log of the number of observations.
 Thus, the sharp drop on the right side is purely a sample-size effect.
 Trimming does not appreciably change the sahpe of this distribution, other
 than to eliminate the very highest MI values.

This distribution is not language-specific; a nearly identical distribution

\begin_layout Section*
MST Parsing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Armed with word-pair data, one can proceed to perform Maximum Spanning Tree
 (MST) parsing, as described by Yuret.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yuret1998"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 One considers all possible trees connecting all of the words in a sentence,
 and, out of all of these trees, the one with the greatest sum-total MI
 of the edges is selected.
 A number of different algorithms for finding this tree exist; they all
 give reasonable results, and do not appear to affect overall results.
 A variation is the Maximum Planar Graph (MPG), which takes the above tree,
 and adds edges for high-MI pairs, as long as edges don't cross and the
 MI is above a threshold.
 Experience with Link Grammar (LG) suggests that MPG parses offer a significant
 advantage over trees.
 In LG, the necessity for grammatical agreement between nearby words introduces
 a stringency and rigidness to the resulting parses, resulting in a greater
 rejection of bad parses.
 This result should carry over to the present case, and should help constrain
 the learned grammar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given an MST or MPG parse, each edge is cut in half, and the half-edge is
 labelled with the word it used to connect to.
 This results in a connector sequence for each word, some connectors connecting
 to the left, some to the right.
 Following the LG convention, these connector sequences are called disjuncts
 (for short), as they are disjoined when considering an LG parse.
 Denoting the word as 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 and the disjunct as 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, this results in word-disjunct pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Parsing a large corpus this way, the counts are accumulated in the database,
 to give a count 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In the current codebase, the counting is done without weighting; one could
 consider also counting with weighting, giving higher weight to those disjuncts
 that seem confident.
 Anyway, given the counts 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

, one can again play the matrix game, and examine marginal and conditional
 probabilities, and the word-disjunct MI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thing one notices is that there are vastly more disjuncts than
 there are words: two orders of magnitude more! Next, one notices that the
 vast majority of disjuncts are observed only once.
 This raises the question: what is signal and what is noise?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, there is a question of what is signal, and what is noise.
