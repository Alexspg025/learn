* polarity is indeterminate in this example.
* It can be multi-polar, and not just two polarities.
* Biologists have found species of fungus that have 
  43 different types of sex, some of which can mate,
  and some which cannot. 

Slide physics:
* Anything tensorial

Link Grammar:
* The LG type system is oversimplified, here. The type matching system
  is more complex, and polarity +/- indicate left-right.

Vision:
* Polarity direction is arbitrary, here, but there are differrent
  kinds of connectors - up-down vs shape vs color.

Audio:
* This is a whale song from NOAA.

Lexical entries
* ampersand resembles "linear logic"
* Tensorial notation popular in quantum-influenced thinking
* hat-e is a unit basis vector

Similarity scores
* Problem with assuming Euclidean space is that taking orthogonal
  projections can lead to negative probabilities. Its pathological.
* Experimental measurements show that cosine distance is low quality
* MI is well-behaved under Markov (affine) transformations.
* Star means sum over everything
* It's a weighted word probability.

Something from Nothing
* We got lucky with the words
* We need to find processors that convert input intto "words".
* Extremely high dimensional .. billions!


vision -- there was a pipeline of processing
add pipeline to vision.

factoring the word-disjunct matrix

is this a gaussian unitary ensemble?
