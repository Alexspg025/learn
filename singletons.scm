; Compute the occurance logliklihoods for a list of atoms.
;
; This sums up the occurance-count over the entire list of atoms,
; and uses that as the normalization for the probability frequency
; for the individual atoms in the list. It then computes the log_2
; likelihood for each atom in the list, based on the total.
;
; As usual, the raw counts are obtained from the 'count' slot on a
; CountTruthValue, and the logli is stored as a value on the atom.
;
; This returns the atom-list, but now with the logli's set.

; Compute the occurance logliklihoods for all words.

; Load all word-nodes into the atomspace from SQL storage, if they
; are not already present.  This also loads the associated values.

; This returns the list of all word-nodes, with the logli's set.
