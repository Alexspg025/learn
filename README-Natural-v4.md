Integrated Natural Language System
==================================
* November 2022.

This is a revised version of the earlier [Unsupervised Natural Language
Learning README Version 3](./attic/run-v3/README-Natural-v3.md), updated
to reflect a new integrated process that enables continuous learing.

A general overview, including pre-requistes, is provided by the
[Unsupervised Natural Language Learning README](./README-Natural.md) file.

This integration is in development; the instructions below are incomplete.
