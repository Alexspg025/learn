Dead, unused code that might still be interesting.

* __cluster__: Assorted attempts at clustering words into clusters.
    None worked out, due to complexity, bugs, mis-design,
    mis-understanding what the actual problem was.
 
Stuff below should be deleted a few years after being declared dead.

* __singletons.scm__: Code for working with single words.  Not used
    anywhere. Well, used in the summary reports below.

* __summary.scm__: Stale, boring report printer. The reports are anemic.
    Other than that, they do work.
