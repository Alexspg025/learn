Dead, unused code that might still be interesting.

* __batch-clique-pair.scm__: Matrix object API's for "clique pairs" and
    "distance pairs". "Clique pairs" are just counts of pairs in a
    sliding window; we don't do that, we've never seriously done that.
    The "distance pairs" are word pairs that are a fixed distance apart.
    We've never done that.  So its "good code", just unused. Easy to
    recreate, if/when we'd ever need this.
