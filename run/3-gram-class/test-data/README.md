Test datasets
=============
This is a collection of datasets that can be used for parse accuracy
comparisons. Included are:

* `corpus-basic.batch` -- A copy of the usual Link Grammar basic
   test corpus.  This contains 579 valid English sentences; most are
   short to medium in length.

* `corpus-fixes.batch` -- A copy of the usual Link Grammar updated
   test corpus. A total of 4236 sentences, almost all quite short.

* `ull-child-directed-speech.txt` -- The ULL project "CDS corpus",
   approx 1800 short sentences spoken by adults to children. All
   are very short.

* `ull-golden.txt` -- The ULL project "Golden Corpus". A total of 229
  sentences, mostly medium-short in length.

* `ull-silver-short.txt` -- A short version of the ULL project
   "Silver Corpus", consisting of the first 2513 sentences.
  It appears to be the (partial) contents of three books from
  Project Gutenberg: Kilmeny of the Orchard (Lucy Maud Montgomery),
  Peter Rabbit (Thornton W Burgess), and a portion of Under the Lilacs
  (Louisa May Alcott).

* `wikipedia.txt` -- A concatenation of three English Wikipedia
  articles: "Autoethnography", "Astor House Hotel (Shanghai)", and
  "History of Virginia".  These are remarkable, as the sentences
  are all quite very long. A total of 312 sentences.
