Atomspace deduplication repair scripts
--------------------------------------

Due to bugs, the SQL backend can end up with multiple copies of
atoms. This script will find them, merge them, and sum the counts
on the associated count truth values.  Its up to you to recompute
anything else.

The scripts are semi-manual. A lot of manual fiddling is required.

First check for multiple ANY atoms:
  select * from typecodes where typename='LinkGrammarRelationshipNode';

reports that type=89 is LinkGrammarRelationshipNode)
Then see how many:
   select * from atoms where type=89 and name='ANY';

If more than one, start with ./any-merge.scm


First, edit common.scm and set do-update to #f --
  -- this will avoid clobbering your data.
  -- tehn run ./dedupe-pairs.scm and see what happens..

Next, edit common.scm and set do-update to #t --
  -- this is the actual run.

Then review contents of and run word-merge.scm
then delete the duplicate WordNodes by hand.

Then run dedupe-pairs.scm a second time ...

Finally, fix the indexes, manually:
\di
DROP INDEX linkidx;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX linkidx ON Atoms(type, outgoing);
DROP INDEX nodeidx;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX nodeidx ON Atoms(type, name);

ALTER TABLE atoms ADD UNIQUE (type, outgoing);
ALTER TABLE atoms ADD UNIQUE (type, name);


and then remove duplicates again with ./eval-dedup.scm

After scrubbing, we may end up with Links that specify children that
are not in the atomspace. Check for these with ./check-oset.scm

Working on Rohit's dataset.
psql simple_pairs
SELECT Count(*) from atoms; gives 9 230 537 -- that is 9 million or so
Of these, there are --
   3 636 569 ListLinks
   5 453 952 EvaluationLinks
     139 884 WordNodes
select count(*) from atoms where type=8;

Find the ANY node:
61 | LinkGrammarRelationshipNode
select * from atoms where type=61;

arghhh. There are 6 of these...
(map count-evlinks (list 57 139 140 186 190 270))

These are being handled at the rate of 100 per second.
so 5.5M 55K seconds == 15 hours!!! ouch.

Relabel any uuid 139 to 57
Changed uuid count was 833348

Changed 190 to 57

argh do it again:
Relabel ANY uuid 139 to 57
Relabeled uuid count was 101662




select uuid,stv_count from atoms where type=61;

(6 rows)

select sum(stv_count) from atoms where type=61;
    sum
