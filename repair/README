Atomspace deduplication repair scripts

Due to bugs, the SQL backend can end up with multiple copies of
atoms. This script will find them, merge them, and sum the counts
on the associated count truth values.  Its up to you to recompute
anything else.

The scripts are semi-manual.

First, edit dedupe-pairs.scm and set do-update to #f -- 
  -- this to make sure everything is working OK.
Next, edit dedupe-pairs.scm and set do-update to #t --
  -- this is the actual run.

Then review contents of and run word-merge.scm
then delete the duplicate WordNodes by hand.

Then run dedupe-pairs.scm a second time ...

Finally, fix the indexes, manually:
\di
DROP INDEX linkidx;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX linkidx ON Atoms(type, outgoing);
DROP INDEX nodeidx;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX nodeidx ON Atoms(type, name);


Arghh ... there are two ANY atoms :-(
